:mod:`plainbox.impl.ctrl` -- Controller Classes

Controller classes implement the glue between models (jobs, whitelists, session
state) and the rest of the application. They encapsulate knowledge that used to
be special-cased and sprinkled around various parts of both plainbox and
particular plainbox-using applications.

    A combo controller for CheckBox-like jobs.

    This controller implements the following features:

        * A job may depend on another job, this is expressed via the 'depends'
          attribute. Cyclic dependencies are not allowed. A job will become
          inhibited if any of its dependencies have outcome other than
          OUTCOME_PASS
        * A job may require that a particular resource expression evaluates to
          true. This is expressed via the 'requires' attribute. A job will
          become inhibited if any of the requirement programs evaluates to
          value other than True.
        * A job may have the attribute 'plugin' equal to "local" which will
          cause the controller to interpret the stdout of the command as a set
          of job definitions.

        requirement expressions against. Each time a result for a resource job
        is presented to the session it will be parsed as a collection of RFC822
        records. A new entry is created in the resource map (entirely replacing
        any old entries), with a list of the resources that were parsed from
        the IO log.

        Local jobs produce more jobs. Like with resource jobs, their IO log is
        parsed and interpreted as additional jobs. Unlike in resource jobs
        local jobs don't replace anything. They cannot replace an existing job
